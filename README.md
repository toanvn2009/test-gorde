# Agile
Welcome to Agile - Premium Shopify Theme!
The theme offers a seamless blend of style and functionality, immersing your customers in a captivating visual experience that radiates professionalism and trustworthiness. It is incredibly easy to use for your Shopify theme projects. We are confident that the Agile Shopify theme will significantly increase your sales conversion rate and boost profits at your Shopify store.

* **Web-native in its purest form:** Theme runs on the [evergreen web](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/evergreen-web/),leveraging the latest web browsers to their fullest potential. We also ensure support for older browsers through progressive enhancement, without relying on polyfills.
.
* **Lean, fast, and reliable:** Functionality and design defaults to “no” until it meets this requirement. Code ships on quality. Themes must be built with purpose. They shouldn’t support each and every feature in Shopify.
* **JavaScript not required, fails gracefully:** We extract every bit of speed and functionality out of HTTP, semantic HTML, and CSS before writing our first line of JavaScript. JavaScript can only be used to progressively enhance features.
* **Server-rendered:** HTML must be rendered by Shopify servers using Liquid. Business logic and platform primitives such as translations and money formatting don’t belong on the client. Async and on-demand rendering of parts of the page is OK, but we do it sparingly as a progressive enhancement.
* **Functional, not pixel-perfect:** The Web doesn’t require each page to be rendered pixel-perfect by each browser engine. Using semantic markup, progressive enhancement, and clever design, we ensure that themes remain functional regardless of the browser.
